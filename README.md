### Date created

### Files used
- us_bike_share_project_vinicius-gerez.py
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
When trying to figure out how to best deal with *caseless matching* I consulted [Programiz' article on Python String casefold()](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/casefold).

I found help into how to *extract the day of the week* from a specific CSV doc. column in this [Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30222533/create-a-day-of-week-column-in-a-pandas-dataframe-using-python).
